Location-based Analysis of Restaurants
Project Overview

This project performs a location-based analysis of restaurants using geographical and city-level information from a restaurant dataset.
The analysis focuses on understanding how restaurants are distributed across different locations and how factors such as ratings, price ranges, and cuisines vary by city.

This implementation is text-based only, making it suitable for academic labs and practical exams.
